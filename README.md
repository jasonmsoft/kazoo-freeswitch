Kazoo-FreeSWITCH
================

This repository is a fork of the FreeSWITCH project modified by 2600hz to fulfill specific needs of the Kazoo platform. The branches of this repo track the offical FreeSWITCH tags with 2600hz modifications. If you are developing with Kazoo or deploying from source please choose from these branches.


_If you are not using the Kazoo platform please use the offical FreeSWITCH repo at https://stash.freeswitch.org/scm/fs/freeswitch.git_
